This project is a professional portfolio for a computer web developer career. This professional portfolio is presented for myself. 
If you click on the nav bar's topics, you will be transferred down to that box that you want to read. 

# Technology used
This code uses HTML and CSS.
This website shows my bio, skills, upcoming certificate, and my contact. The portfolio has gradiential orange and red boxes for the txt boxes.
The outline is apealing. 
I wrote this project because I will be able to get a web developer job after October. Hence, I need a professional portfolio. This is just the first.
